<!-- load scripts here -->
<!-- 
	NOTE: if we load scripts here like we would normally do, they will 
	generate an error if using the standard .load() method of ajax.  
	The issue stems from the fact that without a "suffixed selector 
	expression," .load() will actually attempt to run the scripts that the 
	loaded material contains.  It does this by passing the new data through 
	the .html() method before it begins its insertion into the DOM.  Since
	ajax is asyncronyous, it is possible that more than one script could 
	be running at the same time.  This behavior has been deemed bad for
	the user and so this strategy is deprecated.  Thus a new strategy
	must be created.... see the php submodule tests for examples.
